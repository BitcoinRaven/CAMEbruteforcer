# Flipper Zero Sub Files To Brute-Force CAME 12bit Gate.

## About the Project

**433.92Mhz/CAMEbruteforcer433.py**: will generate sub files which have all the possible keys combination for CAME gate (12bit code/433.92 Mhz), the code will generate multiple files splitted by user choice (500 keys in a file, 1000... etc).

**868.35Mhz/CAMEbruteforcer868.py**: will generate sub files which have all the possible keys combination for CAME gate (12bit code/868.35 Mhz), the code will generate multiple files splitted by user choice (500 keys in a file, 1000... etc).

## Changelog 

**12-Aug-2022** : -Time reduced! the whole script now complete in ~4 minutes.
			Folder created automatically
			
**17-Aug-2022** : -File names updated for better display on flipper.


## Installation

Tested for **Python 3.10.0+**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BitcoinRaven/CAMEbruteforcer.git
$ cd CAMEbruteforcer
```

## Usage

Just run the script and it will generate all the required files.
```bash
$ python CAMEbruteforcer.py
```

## Practical Guide for Brute-Force attack using sub files.

This process is the best I can get with the current flipper firmware.

1. Start with the 1000 keys file, each file will take around 1 minute. (for example the gate opened on file "1000-1999.sub")
2. Go to the next set of files with 500 keys files, you need to run two files now (in our example we need to run  "1000-1499.sub" and "1500-1999.sub"), lets assume    it opened with "1500-1999.sub" file.
3. Go to the next set of files with 100 keys files, you need to run five files now, each file will take 5 seconds to run.
4. if you feel you really need to know the exact code, generate less files with the script (50, 10...) and continue the same process.
